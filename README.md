## ✨ ~ Simple CRUD with login register in laravel ~ ✨

</center>

✨ 👋 Hi Everyone 👋 ✨

Here I will share a Laravel project, where this project only contains CRUD. This project is suitable for those of you who want to learn CRUD flow and creation in Laravel. I created 2 roles to log in, namely admin and student. To use CRUD I used everything on the student page, while for the admin section after logging in I emptied the page so you can experiment with creating views in the admin section.

## Step after your clone this project :

-   Go into directory "Project"
-   copy file .env.example and rename to .env
-   create new database with name "simple_todo"
-   open terminal and go to directory "Project"
-   then run command "composer install"
-   run command "php artisan migrate:refresh --seed"
-   final step you can run command "php artisan serve" for run this project

## Authentication Login :

> To log in as admin, I have provided the following default email and password.

    Email => admin@admin.com
    Password => password

> Meanwhile, to log in as a student, you must register first using the available features.
